# 4x-Solar-System

4X-Solar-System is a mod that makes the solar system 4 times bigger and tilts it to simulate Kerbin's axial tilt. This makes getting into orbit a bit harder because the rocket requires much more deltaV. 

Missions to the Mun are also much harder because the orbit of the Mun is tilted and you have to want for a launch window.

To make the game a bit easyer (and more realistic at the same time) the mod comes with many launch sites to chose from and also for those who use RemoteTech, there are ground stations on kerbin that will help you keep the control over you crafts.

It's ment for people who think that the stock game is too easy but are not experienced enough to play with RSS and RO.
